# Brainster Projects

Here is my 2nd Brainster project.

## Made with:

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,sass)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Set-up instructions:

1. Clone the repository

2. Switch to the appropriate branch (Project-02)

3. Run the [RestAPI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T4mRD47unE8ov0_CyTfriB8URW7wtDmJ/view?usp=sharing)

4. Launch the project using a live server (Required due to a CORS request issue)

- If any features that use local storage need to be tested multiple times, clear local storage and refresh the page.

### List of changes/additions to the original figma design:

- Added a burger menu for navigation on mobile devices

- Added a log-out button

- Added a button that allows for modals to be closed

- Altered the look of the badges displayed on the profile page; this was done because the original icons were transparent when downloaded.
