[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,sass)](https://skillicons.dev)

## How to set up:

1. Clone the repository
2. Switch to the appropriate branch (Project-02)

4. Launch the project using a live server (Required due to CORS request issue)

- If any features need to be tested multiple times, simply clear local storage and refresh the page.
